 This the main repository for the DARPA IDEA ALIGN project led by University of Minnesota.
 

# Design Flow 
```bash
  - Continuous Integration using circleci to integrate code from multiple developers. 
  - Each checkin is verified automatically before merging.
  - Code coverage and quality checks are done.

```
## Design database:
 * Contains example circuits with netlist, schematic
 
## Build : 

* Docker setup initialization for c++/python


## Circuit Annotation :

* Sub_circuit_identification: Reading and annotating netlist
```bash
  - Generates a verilog file for input circuit. 
  - Generates input for parametric cell generator
```
* Constraints: JSON format (manual)

## PDK abstraction: (Some parts are private)

* PDK_Abstraction: JSON file format
* CellFabric: Parametric cell generation
```bash
  - Creation of LEF and GDS for cells based on PDK data ( private github)
  - The sizing is parameterized based on sizing in input netlist.
```
## Placement and Routing :  
* PlacemenEditor: 
```bash
  - View and edit placements of leaf cells. 
  - Shows bounding box of all wires while moving around a particular leaf.
```
* Cktgen: Intel detail router example
```bash
  - Takes leaf cell placement and global routing information and setups up the detailed routing task.
  - Run Intelâ€™s detailed router. 
```
## Viewer :
* GDS output: KLayout: https://github.com/KLayout/klayout
* JSON output: Layout viewer from JSON file

## Tutorials: Not exhaustive (WIP)

## Miscellaneous 
```bash
PySat : 
  - SAT-based toolkit
  - SAT-based leaf cell placer
  - SAT-based global router 
  - Full design example for equalizer
```
