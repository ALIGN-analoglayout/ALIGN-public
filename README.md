 This the main repository for the DARPA IDEA ALIGN project led by University of Minnesota.
 
 Look in the *Build* subdirectory for build environments.

The Cktgen directory includes an example flow (placed primitives, global routing, detailed routing, and layout visualization.)
A sample process technology is included as well.
