Database
=====================
Structure of the Database

.. figure :: ../images/CircuitDatabaseStructure.PNG


Sized netlists
-------------------
Contains sized netlists in different technology nodes. Designs from four classes of circuits:

* Low frequency analog
* Power Management
* Wireless/Radio frequency
* Wireline

Unsized netlists
-------------------
Contains unsized netlists generated for training GCN based netlist annotation. Currently contains designs from low frequency analog.


Generalized testbenches
---------------------------
Contains exhaustive testbenches suited for circuits with different internal topologies with similar functions and pin structure.
Generalized testbenches enabling plug and play of common modules with different internal topologies to exhaustively characterize their performance
