This folder contains example circuits (some of which have been taped out) that can be used as benchmarks.

The circuits are mainly classified into 4 catergories:

1. General/Low Frequency Analog : For eg. amplifiers, comparators etc.

2. DC DC Converters : For eg. buck converter, LDO, power management and related circuits.

3.  I/O or Wireline : For eg. equalizers, etc.

4. Radio Frequency : For eg. Low noise amplifiers, mixers, etc.

Circuit_Information_list : Contains information about the circuits that are currently available and their corresponding files.
