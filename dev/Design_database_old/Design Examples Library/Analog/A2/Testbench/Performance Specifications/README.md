Comparator performance specifications

The negative input is kept constant while the positive input is increased and decreased to evaluate the performance.

1. Rise time - The output rises 2ns after the positive input becomes greater than the negative input. This limits the speed of operation to less than 500 MHz.

2. Fall time - The output falls 2ns after the positive input becomes less than the negative input. This limits the speed of operation to less than 500 MHz.

3. Hysteresis - This comparator has no hysteresis. Output switches from high to low and low to high at the same voltage.

4. Power consumption - Power consumption of this comparator is approximately 23uW.
