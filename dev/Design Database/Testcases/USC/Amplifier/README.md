Contains the BS amplifier circuit from the University of Southern California.

Amplifier_1 : Contains the files for the amplifier circuit which includes the amplifier and current mirror bank stage (verilog netlist, .lef, constraints). The spice netlist contains annotated hierarchy.

Amplifier_2 :  Contains the files for the amplifier circuit which includes the amplifier and current mirror bank stage (verilog netlist, .lef, constraints). The hierarchy in the input netlist has been removed.
