# Sized netlists

Designs from four classes of circuits:

### Low frequency analog

For eg. OTAs, Comparators, ADCs, DAC, Switched capacitor filter

### Power Management

For eg. Switched Capacitor DC-DC converters, Low dropout voltage regulators

### Wireless/Radio frequency

For eg. LNA, Mixer, Bandpass filter, Oscillator

### Wireline

For eg. Variable gain amplifier, linear equalizer

Typical constraints related to these classes of circuits are shown in the figure below.

## Testbenches

Testbenches inside the circuit folder contain excitations and simulations to measure important performance metrics of the circuit.
