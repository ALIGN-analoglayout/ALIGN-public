# ALIGN: Hierarchical Analog Placer and Router Flow

## Brief description
The Hierarchical Placer and Router Flow automatically generates layouts for constraints-based analog designs. There are four components in the flow: 
* _Hierarchical Database (HD)_, which stores the data of hierarchical analog designs and constraints.
* _Common Centroid Capacitor (CCC) Placer and Router (P&R)_, which generates common centroid layout for capacitor array when necessary.
* _Analog Placer_, which places the hierarchical blocks and handles geometrical constraints, such as symmetry, and alignment constraints.
* _Analog Router_, which handles routing constraints, such as symmetry, shielding and parallel routing constraints, and is composed of global router, detailed router and power router.

## Software description

Inputs:
* Analog designs

  - Verilog netlist
  - LEF
  - XX.gds.json for subblock in Verilog netlist
  - GDSII map file
  - PDK file

* Constraints file

* Example: [testcase_example](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public/tree/master/PlaceRouteHierFlow/testcase_example)

Outputs: 
* Analog design layouts

  - XX.gds.json

## Installation/getting started

### Prerequisite

* g++ 7.2 or above
* ILP solver: version 5.5.2.5 <http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/>
* C++ json library: <https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git>
* C++ boost libraries: <https://github.com/boostorg/boost>
* GTEST: <https://github.com/google/googletest>

### Run in Docker
Please follow the instructions in [run in docker](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public/blob/master/build/README.md)

### Run in local
1. Set environment
```Shell
export LP_DIR=<LP_DIR>/lpsolve
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<LP_DIR>/lpsolve/lp_solve_5.5.2.5_dev_ux64
export JSON=<JSON_DIR>/json
export BOOST_LP=<BOOST_DIR>/boost
export GTEST_DIR =<GTEST_DIR>/gtest/googletest/googletest
```
2. Compile the flow
```Shell
make
```
3. Run test case
```Shell
./pnr_compiler testcase_DIR testcase.lef testcase.v testcase.map testcase.json testcaseTop numOfLayout optEffort
```

Inputs explanation:
* testcase_DIR: string type; the directory of input data
* testcase.lef: string type; LEF file
* testcase.v: string type; Verilog file
* testcase.map: string type; map file for gds.json
* testcase.json: string type; PDK file in.json format
* testcaseTop: string type; top module name in netlist
* numOfLayout: integer type; the max number of generated layouts
* optEffort: integer type; optimization effort in range of 0 to 2 (0: low, 1: median, 2: high)

Outputs explanation: (all the results will be saved under 'Results' folder by default)
* xx.plt: GNUplot file of placement results
* Capxx.gds.json: JSON format of CCC P&R layout
* xx_PL.gds.json: JSON format of placement layout
* xx_GL.gds.json: JSON format of global routing layout
* xx_DR.gds.json: JSON format of detailed routing layout
* xx_PR.gds.json: JSON format of power routing layout

## Usage

If the flow is run locally, the operations listed below are necessary:

1) To get the XX_gds.json file, Verlog file, Map file and LEF file, please use the code [Cell Generation](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public/tree/master/align/cell_fabric)

2) To get the PDK file, please use the code [PDK abstraction](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public/tree/master/pdks)

3) Currently the input/output layout files are in JSON format. To convert the format (from json to GDSII or from GDSII to json), please use the codes [GDSConv](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public/tree/master/align/gdsconv).

## Limitations

1) The flow is mainly developed and tested by [ASAP7 PDK](http://asap.asu.edu/asap/). The code is being updated to support the FinFET MockPDK. The flow has been applied by the ALIGN team to synthesize designs in a commercial FinFET process and a commercial bulk process. In the future, the flow should be able to to run more test cases by other PDKs. 

## To-do

1) Top-down placement optimization.
2) Guard ring insertion.
3) Data structure optimization.
4) Detailed router code optimization.
5) Exercising more complex test cases for routing constraints.
