This folder contains the different versions of switched capacitor filter circuits (and some associated circuits) that have been tried on the tool

The versions are named chronologically (YYYY_MM_DD) and are described below

switched_capacitor_filter_2018_10_09  : Contains the files (eg. modified netlist (bookshelf format), constraints) of a preliminary first order SC Filter structure that hasn't been sized

switched_capacitor_filter_2018_11_01  : Contains the files (eg. modified netlist (verilog), constraints) of a preliminary first order SC Filter structure that hasn't been sized

switched_capacitor_filter_2018_11_10  : Contains the files (eg. modified netlist (verilog), constraints, LEF) of a preliminary first order SC Filter structure that hasn't been sized

switched_capacitor_filter_2018_11_20  : Contains the files (eg. modified netlist (verilog), constraints, LEF) of a preliminary first order SC Filter structure that hasn't been sized

switched_capacitor_filter_2018_12_06  : Contains the files (eg. modified netlist (verilog), constraints, LEF) of a preliminary first order SC Filter structure that has been sized

switched_capacitor_filter_2018_12_10  : Contains the files (eg. modified netlist (verilog), constraints, LEF) of a preliminary first order SC Filter structure that has been sized and has additional hierarchy introduced

common_centroid_capacitor_array_2019_01_31 : Contains the files (eg. modified netlist (verilog), constraints, LEF) of the capacitor array in the filter circuit that needs to be placed in common centroid configuration
