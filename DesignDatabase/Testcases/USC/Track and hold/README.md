This folder contains the track and hold circuit provided by the University of Southern California

track_and_hold_1 :  Contains files for the track and hold circuit (spice netlist, verilog netlist, .lef, constraints and the final placement results).

track_and_hold_2 :  Contains files for the track and hold circuit (spice netlist, verilog netlist, .lef, constraints and the final placement results). This contains capacitors with different aspect ratios compared to version track_and_hold_1.

track_and_hold_3 :  Contains files for the track and hold circuit (verilog netlist, .lef , and constraints). Additional hierarchy is created to ease placement and routing.
